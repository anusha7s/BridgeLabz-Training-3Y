/**
 * Question 4: Write a Program to check if the given number is a prime number
 * or not.
 * Hint =>
 * a. A number that can be divided exactly only by itself and 1 are Prime
 * Numbers.
 * b. Prime Numbers checks are done for numbers greater than 1.
 * c. Loop through all the numbers from 2 to the user input number and check if
 * the remainder is zero. If the remainder is zero break out from the loop as
 * the number is divisible by some other number and is not a prime number.
 * d. Use the isPrime boolean variable to store the result.
